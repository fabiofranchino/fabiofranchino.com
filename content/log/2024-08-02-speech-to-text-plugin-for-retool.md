This is our first **public plugin** for Retool.

We invest a lot on Retool platform and this is our contribution to improve it further.

It's a little **Custom Component** that adds **Speech to Text** capability to Retool applications.

Technically, it exploits the **Chrome internal Speech-to-Text capability**, exposing some settings and properties.

It does render a single button, trying to mimic the Retool look&feel.

Most importantly, **it's free and open source!**

You can find the full documentation about **installation**, **settings** and **how to use** [here on Github](https://github.com/EloquentOps/retool-plugin-speech2text).
