Although Retool drastically lowers the barriers for internal tool development, consultants bring **expertise** and **strategy** on top of that to maximize Retool's potential, giving businesses not only implement solutions efficiently but also with long-term scalability and flexibility in mind.

Here some key aspects to consider when starting to include Retool as an important internal platform:

### Integrations

Retool simplifies data connections, integrating with complex legacy systems, multiple APIs, or secure data environments. Consultants can provide a deep understanding of how to optimize these integrations, ensuring smooth and secure operations.

### Scaling

Retool simplifies scaling to some degree, ensuring that the tools meet advanced performance and scalability requirements. Large organizations can benefit from consultants with experience in managing scale beyond out-of-the-box setups.

### Customization

Retool provides a lot of flexibility, but consultants can help customize components or add advanced scripting for unique workflows that go beyond what's available in the default interface. This can include performance optimizations, custom UI, or even complex automation that perfectly fits the company's evolving needs.

### Training

Consultants can offer training to in-house teams, accelerating their ability to independently manage and evolve internal tools. While Retool is user-friendly, the learning curve for non-technical users could still exist when working on more complex applications. Consultants can bridge that gap.

### Strategy

Experienced consultants can guide teams on best practices for architecture, security, and maintainability. This goes beyond mere functionality, ensuring that the solutions built today are scalable and secure for the future.

### Optimization

As companies grow, their internal tools must evolve with them. Consultants can provide strategies for ensuring Retool apps grow in complexity and capabilities as the business changes, reducing technical debt and improving long-term sustainability.
