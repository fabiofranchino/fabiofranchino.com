Google Sheets is ubiquitous, and for very good reasons.

There are many statistics around, but aside the numbers, it's safe to say it's everywhere.

Simply because it's easy to adopt it.

Its learning curve, especially for simple tasks, is approachable even for non-technicians. You can accomplish a myriad of tasks with data using Google Sheets

It's truly versatile and powerful.

However, there comes a point when it's crucial to add some safeguards to your spreadsheets. This is particularly true when collaborators need to perform tasks daily, such as checking project statuses, monitoring sales performance, or resolving timesheet conflicts.

This is where a prototyped process needs to evolve into an efficient tool.

Enter **Retool**.

Retool seamlessly integrates with Google Sheets, serving as both a read and write data source. While it's possible to migrate data from Sheets to a proper database, we believe that leveraging existing work is invaluable. So, why not make the most of it in the interim?

There's always time for proper refactoring and restructuring; there's no need to rush.
