The era of "**personal software**" is coming, fueled by AI advancements that will democratize software creation. 

Soon, everyone will be able to create software by simply describing what they want in plain language, skipping the need for extensive technical knowledge. 

This paradigm shift, however, doesn't mean we're building tools for others. Instead, it emphasizes **self-serving software**, designed for **immediate personal use**, tailored to individual needs in real-time.

Today, we invest significant time in searching for tools that match our needs, learning them, and figuring out if they fit into our workflow. 

AI will flip this process upside down, soon, the time it takes to describe what we need will match or be shorter than the time spent researching an existing tool.

While the technology is not perfect yet, it’s improving rapidly. The dream is that soon, with a simple prompt, tools will be created at the speed of thought. The implications of this shift are still hard to predict, but it promises to bring about changes in how we interact with technology and design our digital lives.

In short, the future isn't about mass-producing apps for others—it’s about customizing the digital world for ourselves, one prompt at a time.
