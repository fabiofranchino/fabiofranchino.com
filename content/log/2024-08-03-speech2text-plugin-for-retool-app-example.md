[We made a Retool plugin](https://eloquentops.com/post/Speech-to-Text-Plugin-for-Retool) to include in any Retool application the Speech2Text capability that is built in Google Chrome.

Now we want to give you a sample app with the plugin already included, it you want to test it fast.

The application is pretty easy to use. Once installed, just select the language (en and it, but you can add further language codes) and press the "Start Rec" button and start speaking.

The plugin will record everything is able to capture from the mic. The first time Google Chrome will ask for mic

Now, let's install and start using it!
