The purpose of this tool is to function as a shape generator, enabling users to create various forms effortlessly.

It allows customization by defining parameters such as the number of points, the level of randomness, and the desired color palette, offering a high degree of flexibility.

With these options, users can generate an endless array of unique variations, ensuring a tailored design for any purpose.

Once satisfied with the result, users can easily export their preferred shape as an SVG file, ready for use in digital or design projects.
