While studying the concept **Planning** of AI Agents, we developed a prototype with Retool.

This prototype attempts to implement the concept by using two GPT processes that engage in a dialogue to both support and challenge a given idea from the user. The final text is produced from this interaction and an additional GPT process.

Although it's far from perfect, it demonstrates the potential of this approach. 

The application uses the "Action AI" built-in GPT functions, so, no OpenAI integration is required.

The application is dead easy to use. Once installed, just write your idea and press the button. You need to wait a bit, while you'll see the process, though.

Now, let's install and start using it!

## Create the Retool account.

If you already have one, you can skip this. Otherwise, go through this [link](https://get.retool.com/c2blfe7c4kts) to create a free account. By following to that link **you can have 20% discount** in case you want to upgrade in the future. The basic account is always free, though.

## Install the Retool app

First, [download the source](https://eloquentops.github.io/retool-apps/IdeaChallenger.json) (right-click to download as file) of the Retool app.

It's a JSON file you can then import in your Retool account.:
