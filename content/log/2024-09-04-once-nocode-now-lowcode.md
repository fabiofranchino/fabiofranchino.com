No-code tools were **originally designed** to enable individuals without programming knowledge to build applications and digital solutions. These tools have successfully **democratized technology creation**, making it accessible to a broader audience.

However, the landscape is evolving. **Coding**, specifically in the form of **short code snippets**, is no longer a significant barrier for non-technical individuals. **LLMs and GPT** have made it possible for people to convert plain English into **simple SQL queries or JavaScript conditional statements** with relative ease. This capability is often all that is required on low-code platforms to implement the necessary customizations.

As a result, the **original proposition** of no-code solutions—serving a non-technical audience exclusively—is becoming less valuable. The **inherent limitations** of no-code platforms, which were once acceptable due to their enabling capabilities, are now increasingly seen as **constraints** that are hard to justify.

Given these shifts, there is a **growing expectation** that no-code tools will evolve into **low-code versions of themselves**. This transition reflects a broader trend towards **offering more flexibility and control** while still catering to users who may not have traditional programming skills. The **future of these platforms** likely lies in balancing ease of use with the **power and flexibility provided by minimal coding**.

We believe that platforms like [Retool](https://retool.com/) are going to **dominate** a significant portion of the software development landscape. **You've been warned**.
