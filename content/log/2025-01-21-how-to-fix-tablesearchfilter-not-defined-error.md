If you're using tables in your application and encounter the warning \"tableSearchFilter is not defined,\" follow these troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.

### identify the source of the warning
1. **understand the error**: this warning often appears when there’s a mismatch between the search input and the actual data linked to the table. it usually occurs if you've deleted or modified the variable that filters your table.

### follow these steps
2. **check the search input variable**: ensure the search variable is correctly defined and linked to your table. if it was removed unintentionally, you'll need to redefine it.

3. **disable server-side pagination**: if you are utilizing server-side pagination, disable this feature temporarily. this allows you to see if the search term input is causing the warning.

### implement changes
4. **remove undefined variables**: once you’ve disabled server-side pagination, go through your settings and remove any variables that may be defined as \"undefined.\" this might include unused search term inputs.

5. **re-enable server-side pagination**: after following the above steps, re-enable server-side pagination. ensure that any filters or search inputs align with the expected variables in your data

### verify the solution
6. **check table appearance**: finally, verify that your table displays correctly without the border issues you were experiencing before. if everything is set up properly, the table should function without warnings.

by following these steps, you should resolve the \"tableSearchFilter is not defined\" issue and ensure your table runs smoothly.
