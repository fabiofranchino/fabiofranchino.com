We're releasing our first micro-tool, powered by [MetaTools](https://metatools.eloquentops.com/) suite, developed with [Bolt.New](https://bolt.new).

It's a translation tool that lets you input text and get it translated into different languages. 

You can select the language you need, and see the results in seconds. It's simple and effective.
