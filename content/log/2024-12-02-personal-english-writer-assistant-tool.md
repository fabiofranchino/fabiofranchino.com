We're thrilled to unveil the latest addition to the [MetaTools](https://metatools.eloquentops.com/) suite: **a personal English writing assistant**.

### What makes it special?

1. **AI-powered suggestions**: This tool leverages advanced AI to propose variations of your text, ensuring your message shines through while keeping your unique voice intact.
2. **Customizable prompts**: One size doesn't fit all. You can configure the prompts yourself to fine-tune the kind of suggestions you receive, putting you in control of your creative process.
3. **Translation for clarity**: It offers translated versions of your text, so you can double-check the meaning and accuracy across different languages.
4. **Cherry-Picking at its best**: You’re not bound by a single suggestion. Choose the best sentence variations from the two provided versions, mixing and matching to craft your perfect output.
